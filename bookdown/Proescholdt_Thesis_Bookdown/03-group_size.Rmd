# Group Size {#grp_size}

One of my main questions is about group size, and how it scales with population. To investigate this, I will first need to examine the group size.

```{r group size, eval = TRUE, echo = TRUE}
#What was the biggest group observed and when?
census %>%
  as_tibble %>% 
  select(group_size, date) %>%
  group_by(group_size) %>% 
  arrange(desc(group_size))
  
```
It looks like the largest group was observed in June of 2014, and it was 85 individuals!

I am curious about what group size is observed most frequently and what the average group size is for the whole dataset.

```{r mode group}

```


Now, I want to know more about how group size is related to other factors like population size and sex ratio. To start exploring this, I want to look into when groups of different sizes occur and how that has changed over the 40 years in this dataset.
